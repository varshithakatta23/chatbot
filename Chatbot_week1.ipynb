        "  - Tokenization (e.g., using NLTK or spaCy)\n",
        "  - Stopword removal\n",
        "  - Stemming or Lemmatization\n",

        "- Use the train_test_split function from scikit-learnâ€™s model_selection module to split your preprocessed DataFrame into three sets:\n",
        "  - Training set (e.g., 70% of the data)\n",

        "  - Testing set (e.g., 15% of the data)\n",
        "- Specify the test_size parameter to control the proportion of samples in each set. For example, test_size=0.3 would allocate 30% of the data to the testing set.\n",
        "- Set the random_state parameter to ensure reproducibility and consistency across splits.\n",
